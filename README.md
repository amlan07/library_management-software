# library_management-software
Its a software to manage a library where the available books and copies will be stored in a file. A use has to create a id to log in and after that he can take a book and i have put a restriction that a single user will be able to issue 1 book only there will have to return the book to issue new book. There is a admin section from where the software can be controlled. there a admin can add a book , remove a book, block some user . To log in as a admin you have to put a password and valid main and it depends on the developer whome will get the admin control. and a user can also change his own password.
